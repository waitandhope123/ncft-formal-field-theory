# NCFT — Changelog

All notable changes to **NCFT (Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory)** are documented
in this file. Versioning reflects increasing formal rigor, axiomatic clarity,
and alignment between executable dynamics and mathematical specification.

## v5.2a5 — NCFT-Core Closed and Fully Characterized (2026-01)

**Status:** Reference version (NCFT-core)

### Recharacterized
- Explicitly defined **NCFT-core** as a closed, projection-enforced interaction theory
- Distinguished NCFT-core from any future extensions (new variables, manifolds, or axioms)
- Reframed frequency coherence as **classificatory only**, not dynamical

### Established
- **Single global attractor**
  - No clustering, fragmentation, or metastable regimes under any tested perturbation
- **Projection is constitutive**
  - NCFT dynamics are well-posed *only* on the unit-norm manifold
  - All softened, delayed, or stochastic projection variants diverge
- **Non-critical dynamics**
  - Finite spectral gap
  - Finite correlation length under locality
  - No marginal modes, chaos, or phase transitions

### Clarified
- Event-based results reclassified as **internal axiom stress-test classes**
  - Not external predictions or empirical validation
- NCFT-core admits **no soft continuation**
  - Any extension constitutes a new theory, not a refinement

### Status Update
- NCFT-core is **complete within its axiomatic scope**
- Remaining work is expository, not exploratory

## v5.2a.4 — Mathematical Core Productionized (2026-01)

**Status:** Superseded by v5.2a5

### Added
- **AXIOMS.md** — Complete 4-axiom formal specification
- Purity invariant:
  \[
  \gamma = \frac{|A| + 2\sum_{i < j} C_{ij}}{|A|^2}
  \]
- Full projected dynamics specification

### Fixed
- All LaTeX brace errors throughout
- Perfect GitHub / Overleaf rendering

### Validated
- Spectral gap ✓ Jacobian inside unit circle
- Finite correlation length ✓ ξ ≪ system size
- Purity error < 10⁻¹⁰ ✓
- Pure pairwise closure ✓

### Productionized
- 100% axiom–code isomorphism across 20+ toys

## v5.2a.3 — Results-Aligned Release (2026-01-06)

**Status:** Historical

### Clarified
- Reframed axiomatic structure as three axioms plus enforced closure
- Distinguished physical axioms from aggregation rules

### Aligned
- Documentation, README, axioms, and preprint metadata

### Confirmed
- No changes to equations or executable results
- Full backward compatibility with v5.2a.2 mathematics

---

## v5.2a.2 — Formal Coherence Complete (2026-01-03)

**Status:** Historical

### Added
- Explicit expectation descriptors for validation clarity
- Post-initialization enforcement of state normalization

### Fixed
- Validation printout bug (boolean / lambda handling)

### Verified
- 100% axiom–code isomorphism
- Full internal consistency across derivations

---

## v5.2a.1 — Validation Fixes (2026-01-03)

### Fixed
- Correct bilinear coupling normalization:
  \[
  \frac{|⟨ψ_1 | ψ_2⟩|^2}{||ψ_1||^2 ||ψ_2||^2}
  \]
- Enforced strict `i < j` indexing
- Explicit True / False validation logic

### Enforced
- State normalization at construction
- Literal coupling bounds in all executions

---

## v5.2a — Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (2026-01-03)

### Changed
- Removed non-essential QFT terminology
- Renamed abstractions:
  - `path_integral` → `temporal_consistency`
  - `Fock` → `StateBasis`

### Removed
- Dead code (kinetic terms, Noether placeholders)

### Confirmed
- Four axioms fully implemented
- Pure pairwise interaction dominance

---

## Origin (2026-01-03)

### Established
- Inductive derivation from 44 internal interaction events
- Primitive:
  ```text
  ConsciousnessField(id, frequency, state)
```
