# CORE

NCFT-core is defined by a minimal set of axiomatic constraints governing
interaction between unit-normalized field states. These constraints are
structural rather than phenomenological and are jointly necessary and
sufficient to define the bounded, deterministic interaction dynamics
characterized in this work.

## Core Interaction Primitive

Each interacting entity is represented as a unit-normalized field state.
The admissible state space of NCFT-core is the unit-norm manifold. Projection
is constitutive: dynamics are defined only on this manifold. Unprojected or
partially projected evolutions are ill-posed and are not considered valid
NCFT-core dynamics.

## Axiomatic Constraints

1. **Universal Exclusion**  
   Fields do not self-interact. Interaction is defined only between distinct,
   active field identities.

2. **Projected Bilinear Coupling**  
   Interactions occur exclusively through pairwise bilinear overlap between
   projected field states. Coupling strength is bounded within \([0, 1]\).

3. **Pure Pairwise Closure**  
   Collective interaction strength is defined as the sum over all pairwise
   couplings. No higher-order interaction terms appear in NCFT-core.

## Regime Classification (Non-Axiomatic)

Field-associated frequencies may be assigned for classificatory or diagnostic
purposes. Frequency dispersion does not affect stability, alignment, or
attractor structure and therefore does not define validity conditions for
NCFT-core dynamics.

## Derived Dynamical Character (Validated Scope)

Across all valid constructions, NCFT-core dynamics are empirically:

- bounded and deterministic,
- dynamically gapped, with a finite relaxation spectrum,
- strongly stable under perturbation,
- convergent to a single global attractor,
- free of marginal modes, chaos, clustering, or glassy behavior.

These properties are derived consequences of the axioms and constitutive
projection and are not imposed as additional assumptions.

## Applicability and Exclusions

NCFT-core applies exclusively to dynamics defined on the unit-norm manifold
with projected bilinear coupling and pure pairwise closure. Dynamics that
violate projection, introduce higher-order interaction terms, or exit the
admissible state space are ill-posed and lie outside the theory’s domain.

Such constructions may be used as adversarial or falsification probes but are
not considered NCFT-core dynamics.

## Interpretive Status

The CORE defines a sharply delimited universality class of interaction laws.
Executable computational validation demonstrates that relaxing or deforming
any core constraint leads to immediate loss of well-posedness, boundedness, or
deterministic behavior.

NCFT-core is complete as defined. It is not a tunable model family but a fixed
interaction framework. Any extension beyond this CORE—through additional state
variables, alternative manifolds, or modified interaction rules—constitutes a
new theory rather than a refinement of NCFT-core.

No claims are made beyond the interaction class defined here.
