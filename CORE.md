# CORE

NCFT-core is defined by a minimal set of structural constraints governing
interaction between unit-normalized fields. These constraints are axiomatic,
not phenomenological, and are intended to be necessary and sufficient for the
bounded, coherent interaction behavior validated in this work.

## Core Interaction Primitive

Each interacting entity is represented as a unit-normalized field state.
Normalization is enforced at all interaction steps through a projection
operator. Raw or unprojected intermediate dynamics are permitted as
exploratory constructions but are not considered valid NCFT states.

## Axiomatic Constraints

1. **Universal Exclusion**  
   Fields do not self-interact. Interaction is defined only between distinct,
   active field identities.

2. **Bilinear Coupling (Projected)**  
   Interactions occur exclusively through pairwise bilinear overlap between
   projected field states. Coupling strength is bounded within [0, 1].

3. **Coherent-Phase Frequency Consistency**  
   Stable NCFT dynamics exist only within coherent regimes characterized by
   bounded frequency dispersion across active fields.

4. **Pure Pairwise Closure**  
   Collective interaction strength is defined as the sum over all pairwise
   couplings. No higher-order interaction terms are included in NCFT-core.

## Derived Dynamical Character (Validated Scope)

Within the coherent phase, NCFT dynamics are empirically:

- bounded and deterministic,
- dynamically gapped, with a finite relaxation spectrum,
- strongly stable under perturbation,
- free of marginal, chaotic, or glassy behavior.

These properties are derived consequences of the axioms under
projection-enforced dynamics and are not imposed as additional constraints.

## Phase Restriction

NCFT-core applies exclusively to projection-enforced, coherent-phase dynamics.
Decoherent, unprojected, critical, or higher-order interaction regimes are
explicitly treated as non-NCFT dynamics and serve as stress-testing or
falsification controls.

## Interpretive Status

The CORE defines a restricted universality class of interaction laws.
Computational validation demonstrates that relaxing or deforming any core
constraint leads to predictable loss of boundedness, coherence, or inferential
control. NCFT-core therefore represents a stable structural fixed point rather
than a tunable model family.

No claims are made beyond the interaction class defined here.
