# SCOPE

Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT) is a formally defined interaction
field framework whose claims are explicitly limited in dynamical, structural,
statistical, and epistemic scope. The theory is not intended as a general model
of consciousness, cognition, or physical interaction, but as a precise
characterization of a restricted class of normalized, bilinear interaction
dynamics.

## 1. Dynamical Scope

NCFT applies exclusively to projection-enforced, coherent-phase dynamics.
Within this scope, interacting entities are represented as unit-normalized
fields coupled through pairwise bilinear interactions, with collective behavior
restricted by pure pairwise closure.

Extensive validation demonstrates that coherent NCFT dynamics are dynamically
gapped and strongly stable. Perturbations decay on finite timescales, and no
evidence of marginal stability, critical slowing-down, chaotic wandering, or
glassy metastability is observed. Noise and frequency detuning degrade coherence
smoothly and continuously rather than inducing abrupt instability.

Dynamics that violate projection enforcement, exceed defined frequency
dispersion thresholds, introduce higher-order interaction terms, or exhibit
critical or long-range instability are treated as non-NCFT dynamics. Such
regimes are permitted as exploratory or adversarial constructions but are
explicitly outside the theory’s domain.

## 2. Structural Scope

NCFT characterizes a restricted universality class: a finite family of
projection-enforced, approximately bilinear interaction laws that converge to a
common late-time structure. The theory does not claim generic universality,
criticality, or scale-free behavior across normalized dynamical systems.

When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT supports only
short-range collective behavior characterized by a finite correlation length.
This correlation length increases smoothly with coupling strength but saturates
well below system size. NCFT therefore does not naturally approach critical or
long-range regimes under locality.

Relaxation spectra exhibit a finite spectral gap separating slow collective
modes from rapidly damped degrees of freedom. This gapped structure excludes
emergent scale invariance and reinforces NCFT’s effective (rather than
fundamental) character.

## 3. Statistical and Epistemic Scope

NCFT makes statistically testable predictions only within explicitly defined
detectability regimes. These regimes are characterized by sufficient signal
strength, coherence, observability, and sample size. Outside these regimes,
NCFT predicts non-detectability.

Inverse inference is fundamentally limited. While partial discrimination
between structured and null dynamics is possible under favorable conditions,
NCFT does not predict complete reconstruction of underlying interaction
structure from partial or noisy observations. These epistemic limits are
intrinsic and irreducible.

---

## 4. Scale Scope

NCFT behaves as an effective, scale-dependent theory. Under coarse-graining,
aggregated micro-level dynamics approximately track independently evolved
macro-level systems, but exact renormalization closure is not predicted.
Errors remain bounded and non-accumulating within the validated regime.

---

## 5. Explicit Exclusions

NCFT makes no claims regarding:

- Decoherent or unprojected interaction regimes,
- Criticality, scale-free dynamics, or diverging correlation lengths,
- Exact renormalization invariance or generic universality,
- Long-range collective transport under locality,
- Marginal stability, glassy dynamics, or chaotic behavior,
- Complete inverse identifiability from partial or noisy data,
- Empirical correspondence outside explicitly tested regimes.

All results, predictions, and conclusions presented in this work are restricted
strictly to the scope defined above.
