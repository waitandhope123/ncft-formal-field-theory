# CONCLUSION

Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT-core) defines a formally constrained
interaction field framework grounded in a minimal axiomatic core, constitutive
projection enforcement, and pure pairwise closure. Within its explicitly
declared scope, the theory is fully characterized and exhibits boundedness,
internal consistency, and deterministic evolution.

Extensive executable computational validation demonstrates that NCFT-core
dynamics are strongly stable and dynamically gapped. Linear response analysis
reveals finite relaxation timescales and a spectral gap separating collective
modes from rapidly damped degrees of freedom. No evidence of marginal
stability, critical slowing-down, chaotic wandering, or glassy dynamics is
observed under any tested perturbation. All valid flows converge to a single
global attractor, with no clustering, fragmentation, or metastable regimes.

When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT-core supports only
short-range collective behavior characterized by a finite correlation length
that saturates well below system size. This excludes emergent criticality,
long-range order, scale invariance, or scale-free transport. Interaction
topology influences correlation length through its effect on mixing and
damping but does not alter asymptotic behavior.

Frequency coherence plays no dynamical role in stabilization or alignment and
serves only as a classificatory descriptor of regimes. Static or dynamical
frequency dispersion does not alter attractor structure, stability, or
convergence properties.

Under coarse-graining, aggregated micro-level dynamics approximately track
independently evolved macro-level systems, with deviations that remain bounded
and non-accumulating. NCFT-core therefore behaves as an effective,
projection-enforced interaction theory rather than a renormalization-invariant
one. No simple one-parameter scaling collapse is observed, reinforcing the
restricted universality class defined by the axioms.

Collectively, these results establish NCFT-core as a sharply delimited,
physics-grade effective interaction theory with explicit stability guarantees
and clearly defined epistemic limits. NCFT-core does not claim generic
universality, critical behavior, long-range order, scale invariance, or
complete inverse identifiability. Its contribution lies in the precise
delineation of interaction structure, invariants, and boundaries within its
axiomatic scope.

NCFT-core is complete as defined. Any future work—whether empirical
correspondence or theoretical extension—requires explicit modification of the
state space, interaction rules, or axioms and therefore constitutes a new
theory rather than a refinement of NCFT-core.
