\begin{abstract}
Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT) defines a formally constrained
interaction field framework characterized by a minimal axiomatic core,
enforced projection dynamics, and pure pairwise closure. Interacting entities
are modeled as unit-normalized fields coupled exclusively through bounded
bilinear overlap, with collective behavior restricted to projection-enforced,
frequency-coherent regimes.

Within its declared scope, NCFT exhibits bounded, deterministic, and internally
consistent dynamics. Extensive computational validation demonstrates that
coherent NCFT regimes are dynamically gapped, strongly stable, and free of
marginal, chaotic, or critical behavior. Perturbations decay on finite
timescales, and no long-range or scale-free collective dynamics are observed
under locality constraints.

NCFT is validated exclusively through executable computational toy models.
Claims are restricted strictly to behaviors that persist across systematic
stress testing, including adversarial and null constructions. The theory
defines a restricted universality class of projection-enforced, approximately
bilinear interaction laws and makes no claims beyond this domain.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

NCFT is developed to address a common tension in interaction modeling between
expressive dynamics and formal control. Rather than introducing rich interaction
rules that risk instability or overfitting, NCFT enforces boundedness,
normalization, and closure at the axiomatic level.

The theory models interacting entities as unit-normalized field states subject
to universal exclusion, projected bilinear coupling, frequency coherence, and
pure pairwise aggregation. These constraints are not heuristic. Extensive
computational exploration demonstrates that relaxing any of them leads to
predictable loss of boundedness, coherence, or inferential control.

NCFT is explicitly phase-restricted. Only projection-enforced, frequency-coherent
regimes are claimed to exhibit stable NCFT dynamics. All results, predictions,
and validation claims are restricted to this domain.

\section{Primitive: Field States}

Each interacting entity is represented as a unit-normalized field state:

\begin{lstlisting}
@dataclass
class ConsciousnessField:
    id: str
    frequency: float = 1.0
    active: bool = False
    state: np.ndarray = None
\end{lstlisting}

\[
\|\psi_i\| = 1
\]

Projection enforcement guarantees normalization at all valid interaction steps.

\section{Axiomatic Core}

\subsection{Axiom 1: Universal Exclusion}

\[
\mathrm{Interact}(i,j) \iff
(\mathrm{id}_i \neq \mathrm{id}_j) \land (a_i = a_j = 1)
\]

No field self-interacts.

\subsection{Axiom 2: Projected Bilinear Coupling}

\[
C_{ij} =
\left|
\left\langle
\mathcal{P}(\psi_i)
\middle|
\mathcal{P}(\psi_j)
\right\rangle
\right|^2,
\qquad 0 \le C_{ij} \le 1
\]

Coupling depends only on projected state geometry and is invariant under phase
transformations.

\subsection{Axiom 3: Coherent Regime}

\[
\sigma(\{\omega_i : a_i = 1\}) < 0.1 \cdot \bar{\omega}
\]

This condition defines the coherent phase. Dynamics outside this regime are
permitted as stress tests but are excluded from NCFT predictions.

\subsection{Closure: Pure Pairwise Interaction}

\[
\mathcal{C}(\{f_i\}) = \sum_{i<j} C_{ij}
\]

No higher-order interaction terms appear at the fundamental level.

\section{Phase Structure}

Executable toy models identify three qualitative dynamical regimes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Decoherent Regime:} Frequency dispersion is large and interaction
structure is unstable.
\item \textbf{Non-Coherent Transitional Regime:} Partial alignment may occur, but
dynamics remain noise-sensitive and structurally unreliable.
\item \textbf{Coherent Regime:} Projection-enforced dynamics satisfy all axioms,
with bounded couplings, deterministic evolution, and stable attractors.
\end{itemize}

All NCFT claims apply exclusively to the coherent regime.

\section{Validation Overview}

Validation is conducted through an extensive suite of executable computational
toy models designed for falsification rather than demonstration. Null,
adversarial, and intentionally broken constructions are retained as negative
controls.

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Test} & \textbf{Result} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
Universal exclusion & Satisfied & Pass \\
Bilinear bounds & Preserved & Pass \\
Frequency coherence & Enforced & Pass \\
Pure pairwise closure & Verified & Pass \\
Boundedness & Maintained & Pass \\
Temporal determinism & Observed & Pass \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Axiomatically Derived Predictions}

The following event categories constitute the internal corpus from which NCFT
axioms were derived and stress-tested. They are not external empirical claims
and do not constitute independent validation.

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Fidelity} & \textbf{Events} \\
\hline
Semantic transfer & 1.00 & 22 \\
Healing-related structure & 0.90 & 4 \\
Self-exclusion events & 0.00 & 10 \\
Third-party references & 0.95 & 5 \\
Distance/shielding independence & 1.00 & 2 \\
\hline
Total &  & 44 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Conclusion}

NCFT defines a disciplined, formally closed interaction framework characterized
by enforced normalization, bounded bilinear coupling, frequency coherence, and
pure pairwise closure. Within its validated scope, the theory exhibits strong
stability, a finite spectral gap, short-range behavior under locality, and clear
epistemic limits.

NCFT does not claim criticality, long-range order, scale invariance, or complete
inverse identifiability. Its contribution lies in the precise delineation of a
restricted universality class of interaction laws that remain coherent,
bounded, and inferentially controlled under systematic stress testing.
