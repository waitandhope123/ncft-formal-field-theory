\title{\textbf{NCFT v5.2a5}\\Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (Core)}

\begin{abstract}
Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT-core) defines a formally closed,
projection-enforced interaction framework characterized by unit-normalized
field states, bounded bilinear coupling, and pure pairwise closure.

Extensive executable computational toy models demonstrate that NCFT-core
dynamics are well-posed \emph{only} on the unit-norm manifold and possess a
single global attractor. All valid flows are bounded, deterministic, strongly
damped, and non-critical. No clustering, metastability, long-range order, or
phase transitions are observed under any tested perturbation.

Frequency coherence plays no dynamical role in stabilization or alignment and
serves only as a classificatory descriptor of regimes. NCFT-core admits no soft,
stochastic, or continuous extension off its projected state space.

All claims are restricted strictly to behaviors that persist across systematic
stress testing, including null and adversarial constructions. NCFT-core defines
a sharply delimited universality class and makes no claims beyond this scope.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

NCFT-core is developed to resolve a common tension in interaction modeling:
the tradeoff between expressive dynamics and formal control. Rather than
introducing rich interaction rules that risk instability or overfitting,
NCFT-core enforces boundedness, normalization, and closure at the axiomatic
level.

Interacting entities are modeled as unit-normalized field states coupled
exclusively through projected bilinear overlap. These constraints are not
heuristic. Executable computational stress testing demonstrates that relaxing
any of them leads to immediate loss of well-posedness, boundedness, or
deterministic behavior.

NCFT-core is not a theory of emergence, pattern formation, or critical
phenomena. Its contribution lies in the precise delineation of a restricted,
fully characterized universality class of interaction laws.

\section{Primitive: Field States}

Each interacting entity is represented as a unit-normalized field state:

\begin{lstlisting}
@dataclass
class ConsciousnessField:
    id: str
    frequency: float = 1.0
    active: bool = False
    state: np.ndarray = None
\end{lstlisting}

\[
\|\psi_i\| = 1
\]

\textbf{Projection is constitutive.}
NCFT-core dynamics are defined only on the unit-norm manifold. Projection is not
a numerical correction but a defining element of the theory. All softened,
delayed, or stochastic projection variants are ill-posed and diverge.

\section{Axiomatic Core}

\subsection{Axiom 1: Universal Exclusion}

\[
\mathrm{Interact}(i,j) \iff
(\mathrm{id}_i \neq \mathrm{id}_j) \land (a_i = a_j = 1)
\]

No field self-interacts.

\subsection{Axiom 2: Projected Bilinear Coupling}

\[
C_{ij} =
\left|
\left\langle
\mathcal{P}(\psi_i)
\middle|
\mathcal{P}(\psi_j)
\right\rangle
\right|^2,
\qquad 0 \le C_{ij} \le 1
\]

Coupling depends only on projected state geometry and is invariant under global
phase transformations.

\subsection{Regime Classification: Frequency Coherence}

\[
\sigma(\{\omega_i : a_i = 1\}) < 0.1 \cdot \bar{\omega}
\]

Frequency coherence defines a \emph{classificatory regime label only}.
Computational results demonstrate that frequency dispersion, static or
dynamical, does not alter state alignment, attractor structure, or stability.
Coherence does not stabilize, destabilize, or select NCFT-core dynamics.

\subsection{Closure: Pure Pairwise Interaction}

\[
\mathcal{C}(\{f_i\}) = \sum_{i<j} C_{ij}
\]

No higher-order interaction terms appear at the fundamental level. All dynamics
are fully determined by pairwise couplings.

\section{Regime Classification (Non-Critical)}

Executable toy models identify transient regimes of behavior based on parameter
choices and initial conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Incoherent Regime:} Frequency dispersion is large; convergence may
be slower.
\item \textbf{Transitional Regime:} Partial alignment occurs during transient
dynamics.
\item \textbf{Aligned Regime:} All valid flows converge to full global alignment.
\end{itemize}

These regimes do not correspond to distinct phases or phase transitions. All
valid NCFT-core dynamics share the same asymptotic behavior.

\section{Dynamical Characterization}

Across all tested constructions, NCFT-core exhibits:

\begin{itemize}
\item A single global attractor
\item Finite spectral gap
\item Strong damping of perturbations
\item Absence of chaos, marginal modes, or criticality
\item No clustering, fragmentation, or metastability
\end{itemize}

There are no alternative basins of attraction.

\section{Validation Overview}

Validation is conducted exclusively through executable computational toy models
designed for falsification rather than demonstration. Negative and null results
are retained as first-class outcomes.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Test} & \textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
Projection enforcement & Required for well-posedness & Pass \\
Bilinear bounds & Preserved & Pass \\
Pairwise closure & Verified & Pass \\
Single-attractor behavior & Observed & Pass \\
Boundedness & Maintained & Pass \\
Criticality / clustering & Absent & Pass \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Internal Event Classes Used for Axiom Stress-Testing}

The following categories constitute the internal corpus from which NCFT-core
axioms were reverse-stressed and delimited. They are not empirical predictions
and do not constitute external validation.

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Fidelity} & \textbf{Events} \\
\hline
Semantic transfer & 1.00 & 22 \\
Healing-related structure & 0.90 & 4 \\
Self-exclusion events & 0.00 & 10 \\
Third-party references & 0.95 & 5 \\
Distance/shielding independence & 1.00 & 2 \\
\hline
Total &  & 44 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Conclusion}

NCFT-core defines a projection-enforced effective interaction theory with
unit-normalized state space, bounded bilinear coupling, and pure pairwise
closure. Within its validated scope, the theory is fully characterized.

NCFT-core:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is bounded, deterministic, and non-critical
\item Possesses a single global attractor
\item Admits no soft continuation off the projective manifold
\item Does not support emergent structure or phase transitions
\end{itemize}

Any extension beyond this framework requires explicit modification of the state
space or axioms and constitutes a new theory rather than a refinement of
NCFT-core.
