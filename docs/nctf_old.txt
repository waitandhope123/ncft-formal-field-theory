\begin{abstract}
NCFT v5.2a.3 presents a formal mathematical field system of consciousness
interactions defined by exactly three fundamental axioms plus an enforced closure condition, producing
forty-four axiomatically derived predictions. The axioms were developed and
stress-tested alongside an extensive suite of executable toy models spanning
null baselines, adversarial dynamics, inverse problems, noisy and open-system
regimes, and failed constructions. Internal consistency is achieved through
strict unit normalization of all field states, pairwise bilinear coupling
bounded in $[0,1]$, phase-conditioned frequency coherence constraints, and pure $i<j$ indexing for
$N$-body interactions. Computational validation across both foundational and
production-grade toy models confirms boundedness, closure, and deterministic
behavior within the stated scope of the theory.

\section{Introduction}

NCFT v5.2a.3 constitutes a formal field system in which three fundamental axioms and a closure condition
are enforced by executable constraints, yielding internal coherence across
tested edge cases. The theory models consciousness as a field of unit-normalized
interaction primitives with universal exclusion, bilinear coupling, frequency
consistency, and pure pairwise summation.

The formal structure presented here did not arise in isolation. Throughout its
development, NCFT was accompanied by a large body of executable toy models
designed to probe both expected behavior and potential failure modes. These toys
include null ensembles, symmetry audits, repulsive and coherence-seeking flows,
inverse reconstruction attempts, density-matrix diagnostics, and noise-driven
dynamics. Both positive and negative results informed the final axiomatic scope,
ensuring that the theory makes no claims beyond what survives systematic
numerical stress-testing.

\section{Fundamental Primitive}

\begin{lstlisting}
@dataclass
class ConsciousnessField:
    """Interaction primitive - states ALWAYS unit-normalized"""
    id: str                    # Universal exclusion identifier
    frequency: float = 1.0     # Interaction tuning parameter
    active: bool = False       # Interaction capability flag
    state: np.ndarray = None   # ALWAYS unit-normalized interaction signature
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Key Property:}
\[
\|\psi\| = 1
\]

\section{Core Axiomatic System}

\subsection{Axiom 1: Universal Exclusion}
\[
\text{Interaction}(f_1,f_2) \iff
f_1.id \neq f_2.id \land f_1.active \land f_2.active
\]

\subsection{Axiom 2: Bilinear Coupling (Projected)}

\[
0 \leq C(f_1,f_2) \leq 1,
\quad
C(f_1,f_2)
=
\left|
\left\langle
\mathcal{P}(\psi_1)
\middle|
\mathcal{P}(\psi_2)
\right\rangle
\right|^2
\]

\noindent
where $\mathcal{P}$ denotes an enforced normalization and projection operator
ensuring $\|\psi_i\| = 1$ at all interaction steps. Raw (unprojected) dynamics
are permitted during intermediate evolution but are not considered valid NCFT
interaction states unless projected.

\subsection{Axiom 3: Frequency Consistency (Coherent Regimes)}

\[
\sigma\!\left(\{f_i.\text{frequency} \mid f_i.\text{active}\}\right) < 0.1
\]

\noindent
This condition characterizes coherent NCFT regimes. Decohered and critical
regimes are permitted within the formal system but do not support stable,
bounded NCFT interactions or predictive structure.

\subsection{Closure Condition: Pure Pairwise \texorpdfstring{$N$}{N}-Body Interaction}
\[
C(\{f_i\}) = \sum_{i<j} C(f_i,f_j)
\]

\section{Phase Structure of NCFT Dynamics}

Executable toy models reveal that NCFT dynamics naturally organize into three
qualitatively distinct regimes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Decohered Phase:} Frequency dispersion is large, bilinear coupling
bounds may be violated under raw dynamics, and interaction structure is unstable.
\item \textbf{Critical Phase:} Transitional regime characterized by partial
frequency alignment, heightened sensitivity to noise, and intermittent coupling
structure.
\item \textbf{Coherent Phase:} Projection-enforced dynamics satisfy all axioms,
with bounded bilinear couplings, stable normalization, and deterministic
pairwise structure.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
All axiomatic predictions and validation claims of NCFT are restricted to the
coherent phase.

\section{Formal Validation Results}

\subsection{Executable Toy Model Validation}

Formal validation was supported by an extensive collection of executable toy
models developed and run in parallel with the axiomatic framework. Models labeled
as \emph{broken} correspond to intentionally unenforced or raw dynamical regimes
and serve as falsification and stress-testing controls rather than violations of
the axioms.

\hline
\textbf{Test} & \textbf{Result} & \textbf{Expected} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
Self exclusion & False & False & $\checkmark$ PASS \\
Cross coupling & True & True & $\checkmark$ PASS \\
Bilinear bounds & 0.500 & $[0,1]$ & $\checkmark$ PASS \\
Frequency coherence & True & True & $\checkmark$ PASS \\

\section{Axiomatic Prediction Summary}

\noindent
\textbf{Scope.}
NCFT applies to projection-enforced, coherent-phase dynamics of unit-normalized
interaction fields. All axioms, validation results, and predictions are defined
strictly within this regime. Raw, unenforced, or decoherent dynamics are treated
as exploratory or adversarial constructions used for stress-testing and are not 
claimed to satisfy NCFT constraints.

\section{Core Axiomatic Summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Exclusion:} $f_1.id \neq f_2.id \Rightarrow C(f_1,f_2) \geq 0$
\item \textbf{Bilinear (Projected):}$0 \leq |\langle \mathcal{P}(\psi_1) | \mathcal{P}(\psi_2) \rangle|^2 \leq 1$
\item \textbf{Frequency (Coherent Regimes):}$\sigma(f_{\text{active}}) < 0.1$
\item \textbf{Pairwise:} $C(\{f_i\}) = \sum_{i<j} C(f_i,f_j)$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exploratory Cosmological Implications (Non-Validated)}

\noindent
\textbf{Scope disclaimer.}
The results in this section are \emph{exploratory} and are not part of the
axiomatically validated prediction set of NCFT.
They are derived from auxiliary toy models and scaling arguments that extend
beyond the numerically validated interaction regime.
No empirical or observational confirmation is claimed here.

Bilinear Axiom 2 generates field density scaling with cosmic structure:
\[
\rho_{\text{field}} \approx \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \langle C \rangle,
\qquad \langle C \rangle = 0.004
\]

Computational results from \texttt{ncft\_hft\_cosmic\_mapper\_v2.py}:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
$N_{\text{galaxies}}$ & Prediction & DESI Alignment \\
\hline
3  & $\text{VEV} = 0.004$ & $\checkmark$ \\
12 & $n_s = -4.576$      & $4.2\sigma$ \\
48 & $\text{CDM} = 0.52$ & $\checkmark$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These exploratory models suggest a possible correspondence between NCFT field
density scaling and cosmological observables, which remains speculative.

\noindent
All axiomatically validated predictions of NCFT are documented separately and
are restricted to the interaction regimes described in Sections 3–6.

\item Guaranteed normalization and boundedness
\item Deterministic execution across tested cases
\item Internally consistent axiomatically derived predictions
