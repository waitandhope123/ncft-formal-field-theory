# INTRODUCTION

The study of interacting systems often confronts a recurring tension between
expressive dynamical models and formal control. Rich interaction rules can
generate complex behavior, but frequently do so at the cost of boundedness,
stability, identifiability, or predictive clarity. Conversely, highly
constrained models are tractable but may lack structural depth or physical
relevance.

Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT-core) is developed as a response to
this tension. Rather than attempting to model consciousness as a
phenomenological process or emergent narrative, NCFT-core defines a minimal,
formally closed interaction field framework in which boundedness,
normalization, and deterministic structure are enforced at the axiomatic
level. The theory is deliberately narrow in scope and is intended to
characterize a specific class of interaction dynamics rather than provide a
universal explanatory model.

At its core, NCFT-core treats interacting entities as unit-normalized field
states coupled exclusively through pairwise bilinear interactions. A
projection operator defines the admissible state space, restricting dynamics
to the unit-norm manifold, while a closure condition eliminates all
higher-order collective terms. These constraints are not heuristic:
executable computational stress testing demonstrates that relaxing any of
them leads to immediate loss of well-posedness, boundedness, or deterministic
behavior.

NCFT-core exhibits strongly damped, non-critical dynamics. Across all tested
constructions, valid flows converge to a single global attractor, with no
evidence of clustering, metastability, marginal modes, chaotic wandering, or
glassy behavior. Perturbations decay on finite timescales, and no alternative
basins of attraction are observed.

Frequency coherence, defined via bounded dispersion of field-associated
frequencies, serves only as a classificatory descriptor of regimes.
Computational results demonstrate that frequency dispersion—static or
dynamical—does not alter state alignment, stability, or attractor structure.
Coherence neither stabilizes nor destabilizes NCFT-core dynamics.

NCFT-core does not seek criticality, scale-free behavior, or emergent
long-range order. When interactions are restricted to local graphs, collective
behavior remains short-range, characterized by a finite correlation length
that saturates well below system size. No phase transitions or scale
invariance are observed.

Validation of NCFT-core is conducted exclusively through executable
computational toy models designed for falsification rather than
demonstration. The toy suite probes projection enforcement, interaction
topology, frequency structure, clustering, spectral properties, and failure
modes. Both successful and failed constructions inform the final scope of the
theory. Claims are restricted strictly to behaviors that persist across this
validation program.

The goal of NCFT-core is not maximal explanatory reach, but maximal structural
clarity within a precisely delimited interaction class. By sharply defining
its axioms, admissible state space, dynamical character, and epistemic limits,
the theory provides a stable reference framework. Any extension beyond this
core—through additional variables, alternative manifolds, or modified
interaction rules—constitutes a new theory rather than a refinement of
NCFT-core.
