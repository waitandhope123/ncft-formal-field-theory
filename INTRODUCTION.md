# INTRODUCTION

The study of interacting systems often confronts a recurring tension between
expressive dynamical models and formal control. Rich interaction rules can
generate complex behavior, but frequently do so at the cost of boundedness,
stability, identifiability, or predictive clarity. Conversely, highly
constrained models are tractable but may lack structural depth or physical
relevance.

Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT) is developed as a response to this
tension. Rather than attempting to model consciousness as a phenomenological
process or emergent narrative, NCFT defines a minimal interaction field
framework in which coherence, boundedness, and deterministic structure are
enforced at the axiomatic level. The theory is deliberately narrow in scope and
is intended to characterize a specific class of interaction dynamics rather
than provide a universal explanatory model.

At its core, NCFT treats interacting entities as unit-normalized fields coupled
exclusively through pairwise bilinear interactions. A projection operator
enforces normalization and coherence, while a closure condition restricts
collective behavior to pure pairwise contributions. These constraints are not
introduced heuristically: extensive computational exploration demonstrates
that relaxing them leads to predictable breakdowns of boundedness, stability,
or inferential control.

The theory is explicitly phase-restricted. Only coherent regimes—defined by
bounded frequency dispersion and enforced projection—are claimed to exhibit
stable NCFT dynamics. Within these regimes, NCFT dynamics are strongly stable
and dynamically gapped, exhibiting finite relaxation times and no evidence of
marginal stability, chaotic wandering, or glassy behavior. Perturbations decay
rapidly, and coherent attractors dominate late-time dynamics.

NCFT does not seek criticality, scale-free behavior, or emergent long-range
order. When interactions are restricted to local graphs, collective behavior
remains short-range, characterized by a finite correlation length that
saturates well below system size. Under noise and external drive, NCFT admits
stable non-equilibrium steady states with bounded, noise-dominated
fluctuations, reinforcing its interpretation as an effective rather than
fundamental field theory.

NCFT is validated exclusively through executable computational models. An
extensive toy suite probes stability, interaction topology, noise and openness,
inverse identifiability limits, coarse-graining behavior, spectral structure,
and statistical detectability. Both successful and failed constructions inform
the final scope of the theory. Claims are restricted strictly to behaviors that
persist across this validation program.

The goal of NCFT is not maximal explanatory reach, but maximal structural
clarity within a well-defined interaction class. By sharply defining its
axioms, phase constraints, dynamical character, and epistemic limits, the
theory aims to provide a stable foundation for further exploration,
comparison, or potential empirical correspondence—without presupposing such
extensions.
