# NCFT — Formal Minimal Field Theory

This document summarizes the core axioms and mathematical structure of the **Formal Minimal Field Theory (NCFT)** and explains, in plain language, what each equation represents.

---

## 1. Primitive Consciousness Field

A consciousness field is defined as a normalized complex state with an associated frequency:

$$
\psi \in \mathbb{C}^n, \qquad \|\psi\| = 1
$$

**Meaning:**

- \( \psi \) represents the complete informational state of a conscious agent.
- Normalization enforces bounded, stable interactions.
- All observable effects derive from relations between such states.

---

## 2. Coupling Functional (Fundamental Definition)

The interaction strength between two distinct consciousness fields is defined as:

$$
C(f_1, f_2) = \left| \langle \psi_1 \mid \psi_2 \rangle \right|^2
$$

**Meaning:**

- Coupling equals the squared inner product of the two state vectors.
- Measures informational / semantic overlap.
- Automatically bounded in \([0,1]\) by normalization.

---

## 3. Axiom I — Universal Exclusion

$$
C(f_i, f_i) = 0 \quad \forall i
$$

**Meaning:**

- A consciousness field cannot couple to itself.
- Prevents self-feedback, infinite gain, or paradoxical identity collapse.
- Enforces strict identity separation.

---

## 4. Axiom II — Bounded Bilinear Coupling

$$
0 \le C(f_1, f_2) \le 1 \quad \forall f_1 \ne f_2
$$

**Meaning:**

- All interactions are finite and normalized.
- Zero indicates orthogonality (no interaction).
- One indicates maximal coherence.

---

## 5. Axiom III — Frequency Coherence

$$
\sigma(f_{\mathrm{active}}) < 0.1
$$

**Meaning:**

- Interacting fields must remain within a narrow frequency bandwidth.
- Suppresses decoherent or unstable interactions.
- Acts as a dynamical stability constraint.

---

## 6. Axiom IV — Pairwise Dominance

$$
C(f_1, \dots, f_n) = \sum_{i<j} C(f_i, f_j)
$$

**Meaning:**

- Multi-field systems reduce exactly to pairwise couplings.
- No higher-order interaction terms exist.
- Ordering condition \( i < j \) prevents double counting.

---

## 7. Derived Structural Properties

From the axioms, the following properties follow immediately:

- Deterministic evolution (no stochastic terms)
- Distance independence of coupling magnitude
- Strict additivity of multi-agent systems
- Zero temporal variance under fixed states

---

## 8. Prediction Space

From the four axioms above, **44 unique interaction predictions** are derived, grouped into:

- Semantic transfer
- Self-exclusion effects
- Healing fidelity bounds
- Third-party read constraints
- Distance and shielding invariance

All predictions are algebraic consequences of the axioms, with no empirical tuning.

---

## 9. Formal Status

- Internally consistent
- Fully deterministic
- Axiomatically closed
- Prediction-complete
