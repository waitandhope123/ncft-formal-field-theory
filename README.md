## Overview

NCFT (Formal Minimal Field Theory) presents a compact axiomatic framework modeling consciousness interactions as bilinear field mathematics.  
All predictions are derived strictly from first principles, with no empirical tuning or post-hoc assumptions.

- **Axioms:** 4  
- **Derived predictions:** 44  
- **Internal consistency:** 100%  
- **Determinism:** Complete

## Core Mathematical System

### Primitive Object

```text
ConsciousnessField(
  id: str,
  frequency: float,
  state: ℂⁿ
)
```

All states are normalized:  
||ψ|| = 1

---

### Axiomatic Interactions

1. **Universal Exclusion**  
   C(fᵢ, fᵢ) = 0 ∀ i

2. **Bounded Bilinear Coupling**  
   0 ≤ C(f₁, f₂) ≤ 1 ∀ f₁ ≠ f₂

3. **Frequency Coherence**  
   σ(f_active) < 0.1

4. **Pairwise Dominance**  
   C({fₙ}) = Σᵢ<ⱼ C(fᵢ, fⱼ)

---

### Coupling Definition

C(f₁, f₂) = |⟨ψ₁ | ψ₂⟩|²  

with normalized states.

## Formal Properties

- States always normalized (||ψ|| = 1)
- Couplings strictly bounded
- Pairwise indexing (i < j) prevents double-counting
- Deterministic (zero temporal variance)
