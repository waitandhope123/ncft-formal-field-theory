# NCFT v5.2a5 - Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (Core)

**4 axioms → 26+ computational toys → fully characterized NCFT-core**

> Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT-core) is a formally defined interaction
> field framework characterized by a minimal axiomatic core, constitutive
> projection enforcement, and pure pairwise closure. **NCFT-core dynamics are
> dynamically gapped, strongly stable, and free of marginal or chaotic behavior.**

## Key Results

- ✅ **Single global attractor observed**
  - No clustering, fragmentation, or metastable states
- ✅ **Projection is constitutive**
  - All softened, delayed, or stochastic variants diverge
- ✅ **Spectral gap confirmed**
  - Strongly damped dynamics (Toy 11)
- ✅ **Finite correlation length**
  - ξ ≪ system size under locality (Toy 18)
- ✅ **Frequency coherence is classificatory, not dynamical**
  - Does not affect alignment, stability, or attractor structure
- ✅ **Pure pairwise closure verified**
  - No emergent higher-order interactions
- ✅ **44 internal event classes used for axiom stress-testing**
  - Semantic transfer: **f = 1.00** (22 events)
  - Healing-related structure: **f = 0.90** (4 events)
  - Self-exclusion events: **f = 0.00** (10 events)
  - Third-party references: **f = 0.95** (5 events)
  - Distance/shielding independence: **f = 1.00** (2 events)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waitandhope123/ncft-formal-field-theory
cd ncft-formal-field-theory/toys/
python toy_phase_scale_atlas.py  # Demonstrates projection-enforced convergence
```

### What this update accomplishes
- Fully consistent with **v5.2a5**
- Removes overstated or obsolete language
- Adds the **core new results** (single attractor, constitutive projection)
- Corrects epistemic framing without weakening claims
