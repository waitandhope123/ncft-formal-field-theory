# CONCLUSIONS — NCFT INTRINSIC TARGET-OVERLAP DYNAMICS (RESULTS-ALIGNED)

This document states conclusions supported directly by the intrinsic target-overlap
dynamics results. Claims are restricted to demonstrated behavior.

---

## 1. INTRINSIC STABILITY IS SOLVED

Across all tested regimes:

- Norm preservation holds to machine precision
- No coupling violations occur
- Long-time dynamics remain stable

**Conclusion:**  
NCFT is mathematically and numerically stable under intrinsic (tangent-space)
evolution, without projection.

---

## 2. COLLAPSE IS AVOIDABLE AND DYNAMICAL

Purely attractive intrinsic forces collapse to ⟨C⟩ = 1.
Introducing graph-local target overlap prevents this collapse.

**Conclusion:**  
Collapse is not intrinsic to NCFT geometry; it is a consequence of force design.

---

## 3. NCFT SUPPORTS NON-TRIVIAL STRUCTURE

The target-overlap model produces:

- Stable clustered states
- Finite effective rank
- Persistent heterogeneity
- Energy-minimizing equilibria

**Conclusion:**  
NCFT can sustain non-trivial, organized structure under intrinsic dynamics.

---

## 4. STRUCTURE IS CONTROLLABLE

Varying the single control parameter C₀ smoothly tunes:

- Mean overlap ⟨C⟩
- Variance σ(C)
- Effective rank
- Cluster compactness

**Conclusion:**  
Macroscopic NCFT structure is tunable and reproducible, not accidental.

---

## 5. A REFERENCE WORKING REGIME IS ESTABLISHED

The configuration:

- C₀ = 0.25
- Ring graph (k = 4)
- Intrinsic updates

produces the first confirmed stable, non-collapsed, low-rank NCFT dynamics.

**Conclusion:**  
NCFT has transitioned from foundational debugging to phase exploration.

---

## FINAL POSITION

NCFT is now:

- Axiomatically consistent
- Intrinsically stable
- Structurally expressive
- Empirically characterized

The remaining challenges concern mapping phases and interpreting structure,
not repairing mathematical foundations.
