Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT) is a formally constrained interaction
field framework defined by a minimal axiomatic core, enforced projection
dynamics, and pure pairwise closure. The theory models interacting entities as
unit-normalized fields coupled exclusively through bounded bilinear overlap.

Within its declared scope, NCFT exhibits bounded, deterministic, and internally
consistent dynamics. Extensive computational validation demonstrates that
coherent NCFT regimes are strongly stable, dynamically gapped, and free of
critical or chaotic behavior. Perturbations decay on finite timescales, and
collective dynamics converge reliably to dominant coherent attractors.

When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT supports only short-range
collective behavior characterized by a finite correlation length. Under noise,
openness, and external drive, NCFT admits stable non-equilibrium steady states
with bounded energy and noise-dominated fluctuations.

NCFT behaves as an effective, scale-dependent theory and defines a restricted
universality class of projection-enforced, approximately bilinear interaction
laws. The theory does not claim generic universality, criticality, long-range
order, or complete inverse identifiability. Its contribution lies in the precise
characterization of interaction structure, stability, and epistemic limits
within coherent regimes.
