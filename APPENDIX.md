# APPENDIX

This appendix documents the full executable computational toy suite used to
validate, stress-test, and bound the scope of Non-Local Consciousness Field
Theory (NCFT). The toys are not demonstrations of correctness, but systematic
boundary probes designed to identify invariant structure, failure modes, and
epistemic limits.

All toys are fully executable, parameterized, and retained for audit. Failed,
adversarial, and null constructions are preserved as negative controls and are
considered part of the validation record.

## A.1 Core Validation Toy Suite (Toys 1–10)

Toys 1–10 establish the foundational behavioral properties of NCFT, including
boundedness, coherence, topology independence, robustness to perturbation,
inverse identifiability limits, coarse-graining behavior, statistical
detectability, and universality classification.

These toys demonstrate that projection enforcement and pure pairwise closure
are structurally necessary for stable NCFT behavior and that relaxation of
these constraints leads to predictable breakdowns.

(See consolidated summaries in the main text for detailed descriptions.)

## A.2 Extended Physical Diagnostics (Toys 11–16)

Toys 11–16 probe NCFT using diagnostics standard in physical dynamical systems,
including spectral analysis, linear response, noise-driven decoherence,
mean-field approximation, non-equilibrium steady states, and scaling tests.

Key results include:

- Identification of a finite spectral gap and characteristic relaxation
  timescales around coherent attractors.
- Strong linear stability and rapid damping of localized perturbations.
- Smooth, continuous degradation of coherence under stochastic noise.
- Existence of a controlled mean-field approximation with bounded error.
- Stable non-equilibrium steady states under simultaneous drive and
  dissipation.
- Absence of simple one-parameter scaling collapse, reinforcing restricted
  universality.

## A.3 Frontier and Boundary Probes (Toys 17–20)

Toys 17–20 explicitly test whether NCFT approaches criticality, long-range
order, or marginal stability under more adversarial or refined probes.

These include baseline-corrected relaxation measurements, graph-local
correlation length extraction, frequency detuning tests, and fluctuation
spectral analysis in driven and noisy regimes.

Key conclusions are:

- Coherent NCFT dynamics are dynamically gapped and strongly stable, with no
  evidence of critical slowing-down or marginal modes.
- Under explicit locality, perturbation influence decays exponentially with
  graph distance, defining a finite correlation length that saturates well
  below system size.
- Interaction topology significantly shapes correlation length through its
  effect on mixing and damping.
- Frequency detuning alone does not destabilize coherence over explored
  parameter ranges.
- Fluctuation spectra are broadband and noise-dominated, with no emergent
  oscillatory or scale-free structure.

## A.4 Interpretation of the Toy Suite

Taken together, the toy suite maps the behavioral, structural, statistical, and
epistemic space of NCFT. The results establish NCFT as a bounded, strongly
stable, short-range, coherence-seeking effective interaction theory within
coherent regimes.

The appendix does not expand the scope of the theory. Instead, it sharpens and
constrains it by explicitly identifying which physical behaviors do *not*
emerge—criticality, long-range order, scale invariance, marginal stability—
alongside those that do.

No claims are made regarding regimes, observables, or dynamics not explicitly
probed by this suite.
