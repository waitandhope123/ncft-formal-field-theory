# APPENDIX

This appendix documents the full executable computational toy suite used to
validate, stress-test, and delimit the scope of Non-Local Consciousness Field
Theory (NCFT-core). The toys are not demonstrations of correctness, but
systematic boundary probes designed to identify invariant structure, failure
modes, and epistemic limits.

All toys are fully executable, parameterized, and retained for audit. Failed,
adversarial, and null constructions are preserved as negative controls and are
considered part of the validation record.

## A.1 Core Validation Toy Suite (Toys 1–10)

Toys 1–10 establish the foundational behavioral properties of NCFT-core,
including boundedness, determinism, topology dependence, robustness to
perturbation, inverse identifiability limits, coarse-graining behavior,
statistical detectability, and universality classification.

These toys demonstrate that projection enforcement and pure pairwise closure
are structurally necessary for well-posed NCFT-core dynamics and that
relaxation of these constraints leads to predictable breakdowns of
boundedness or determinism.

(See consolidated summaries in the main text for detailed descriptions.)

## A.2 Extended Dynamical Diagnostics (Toys 11–16)

Toys 11–16 probe NCFT-core using diagnostics standard in dynamical systems
analysis, including spectral structure, linear response, noise sensitivity,
mean-field approximation, non-equilibrium steady states, and scaling tests.

Key results include:

- Identification of a finite spectral gap and characteristic relaxation
  timescales around the global attractor.
- Strong linear stability and rapid damping of localized perturbations.
- Smooth, bounded response to stochastic noise without destabilization.
- Existence of a controlled mean-field approximation with bounded error.
- Absence of simple one-parameter scaling collapse, reinforcing restricted
  universality.

## A.3 Frontier and Boundary Probes (Toys 17–20)

Toys 17–20 explicitly test whether NCFT-core approaches criticality,
long-range order, clustering, or marginal stability under adversarial or
refined probes.

These include baseline-corrected relaxation measurements, graph-local
correlation length extraction, frequency detuning tests, and fluctuation
spectral analysis in driven and noisy regimes.

Key conclusions are:

- NCFT-core dynamics are dynamically gapped and strongly stable, with no
  evidence of critical slowing-down or marginal modes.
- Under explicit locality, perturbation influence decays exponentially with
  graph distance, defining a finite correlation length that saturates well
  below system size.
- Interaction topology influences correlation length through its effect on
  mixing and damping.
- Frequency detuning alone does not alter alignment or stability.
- Fluctuation spectra are broadband and noise-dominated, with no emergent
  oscillatory or scale-free structure.

## A.4 Projection and Attractor Structure (Toys 021–026)

Toys 021–026 explicitly probe the constitutive role of projection, the
structure of attractors, and the possibility of extending NCFT-core beyond
its defined state space.

These toys establish that:

- Projection is constitutive of NCFT-core dynamics; all softened, delayed, or
  stochastic projection variants diverge.
- NCFT-core dynamics possess a single global attractor; no clustering,
  fragmentation, or metastable regimes are observed.
- Frequency dispersion, static or dynamical, does not alter alignment,
  stability, or attractor structure.
- NCFT-core admits no continuous or soft extension off the unit-norm
  manifold.

These results close the dynamical characterization of NCFT-core within its
axiomatic scope.

## A.5 Interpretation of the Toy Suite

Taken together, the toy suite fully characterizes the behavioral, structural,
statistical, and epistemic properties of NCFT-core. The results establish
NCFT-core as a bounded, deterministic, non-critical, short-range interaction
theory with a single global attractor.

The appendix does not expand the scope of the theory. Instead, it sharply
constrains it by explicitly identifying which physical behaviors do *not*
emerge—criticality, long-range order, scale invariance, clustering, marginal
stability—alongside those that do.

No claims are made regarding regimes, observables, or dynamics not explicitly
probed by this suite. Any extension beyond these results requires explicit
modification of the state space or axioms and constitutes a new theory rather
than a refinement of NCFT-core.
