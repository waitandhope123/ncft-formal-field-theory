# CONCLUSIONS FROM TOYS 17–20

The combined results of Toys 17–20 establish a coherent and restrictive
physical characterization of NCFT dynamics beyond basic validation.

Key conclusions are:

1. Coherent NCFT regimes are dynamically gapped and strongly stable.
   Baseline-corrected perturbations relax rapidly, with no evidence of
   critical slowing-down or marginal stability across the explored noise
   range.

2. When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT supports only
   short-range collective behavior. Perturbation influence decays
   exponentially with graph distance, defining a finite correlation
   length ξ.

3. Correlation length increases with coupling strength but saturates well
   below system size and does not diverge. NCFT does not naturally approach
   critical or scale-free spatial behavior under locality.

4. Interaction topology plays a decisive role in shaping propagation
   range. Small-world shortcuts enhance mixing and damping, reducing
   coherent persistence relative to locally structured graphs.

5. Coherence in NCFT is strongly enforced by the dynamics. Frequency
   detuning alone does not destabilize alignment over the explored
   parameter range, indicating a built-in bias toward coherent collective
   states.

6. Non-equilibrium steady states exhibit broadband, noise-dominated
   fluctuation spectra with no emergent oscillatory or critical modes,
   reinforcing the picture of a strongly damped, non-critical system.

Together, these results identify NCFT as a gapped, coherence-seeking,
short-range effective collective theory. While capable of supporting
structured local dynamics and non-equilibrium steady states, NCFT does
not exhibit criticality, long-range universality, or scale-free transport
within the tested regimes. These findings define a clear and honest
boundary for the theory’s physical applicability.
