# CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EXTENDED NCFT TOY SUITE

The extended toy suite demonstrates that coherent NCFT dynamics possess
a range of genuinely physical structural features while remaining
consistent with the theory’s deliberately restricted scope.

Key conclusions are:

1. NCFT exhibits characteristic relaxation timescales and a gapped
   linear response spectrum, indicating structured collective dynamics
   rather than generic unconstrained relaxation.

2. Coherent NCFT attractors are linearly stable and strongly damped.
   Local perturbations decay rapidly without long-range propagation
   or marginal instability.

3. Coherence degrades smoothly under stochastic perturbations, with
   noise acting as a continuous control parameter rather than triggering
   abrupt instability.

4. NCFT admits an approximate mean-field (continuum) description with
   bounded, non-accumulating error, consistent with effective field
   theory behavior rather than exact renormalization closure.

5. The dynamics support stable non-equilibrium steady states under
   simultaneous driving and dissipation, demonstrating physically
   meaningful balance far from equilibrium.

6. No simple one-parameter scaling collapse is observed. NCFT defines
   a restricted universality class with real but controlled scale
   dependence, reinforcing prior scope and non-universality claims.

Collectively, these results elevate NCFT from a purely formal interaction
framework to a physics-grade effective theory within coherent regimes.
They establish concrete dynamical, spectral, and non-equilibrium
structure while preserving the theory’s explicit limits on universality,
ontology, and empirical overreach.
