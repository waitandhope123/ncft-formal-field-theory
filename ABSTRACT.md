# ABSTRACT

Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT-core) is a formally defined interaction
field framework characterized by a minimal axiomatic core, constitutive
projection enforcement, and pure pairwise closure. Interacting entities are
modeled as unit-normalized field states coupled exclusively through bounded
bilinear overlap.

Within its declared scope, NCFT-core exhibits bounded, deterministic, and
internally consistent dynamics. Extensive executable computational validation
demonstrates that NCFT-core dynamics are dynamically gapped, strongly stable,
and free of marginal, critical, or chaotic behavior. Perturbations decay on
finite timescales, and all valid flows converge to a single global attractor.

When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT-core supports only
short-range collective behavior characterized by a finite correlation length
that saturates well below system size. No clustering, phase transitions, or
long-range order are observed under any tested perturbation.

NCFT-core behaves as an effective, projection-enforced interaction theory and
defines a sharply delimited universality class of approximately bilinear
interaction laws. The theory does not claim generic universality, critical
behavior, scale invariance, long-range coherence, or complete inverse
identifiability.

All claims are restricted strictly to behaviors that persist across exhaustive
computational stress testing. NCFT-core is complete within its axiomatic scope;
any extension beyond this framework constitutes a new theory rather than a
refinement.
