# ABSTRACT

Non-Local Consciousness Field Theory (NCFT) is a formally defined interaction
field framework characterized by a minimal axiomatic core, enforced projection
dynamics, and pure pairwise closure. Interacting entities are modeled as
unit-normalized fields coupled exclusively through bounded bilinear overlap,
with collective behavior constrained by explicit coherence conditions.

Within its declared scope, NCFT exhibits bounded, deterministic, and internally
consistent dynamics. Extensive computational validation demonstrates that
coherent NCFT regimes are dynamically gapped, strongly stable, and free of
marginal or chaotic behavior. Perturbations decay on finite timescales, and
no critical slowing-down, glassy dynamics, or long-range instability is
observed.

When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT supports only
short-range collective behavior characterized by a finite correlation length.
This correlation length increases smoothly with coupling strength but saturates
well below system size, excluding emergent criticality or scale-free transport.
Under stochastic noise and external drive, NCFT admits stable non-equilibrium
steady states with broadband, noise-dominated fluctuation spectra.

NCFT behaves as an effective, scale-dependent theory rather than a
renormalization-invariant one. Under coarse-graining, aggregated micro-level
dynamics approximately track independently evolved macro-level systems, with
bounded, non-accumulating error. The theory defines a restricted universality
class: a finite family of projection-enforced, approximately bilinear
interaction laws that converge to a common late-time structure.

All claims are restricted strictly to projection-enforced, coherent-phase
dynamics that survive exhaustive computational stress testing. NCFT does not
claim generic universality, critical behavior, long-range coherence, or complete
inverse identifiability. Its value lies in the precise characterization of
interaction structure, stability, invariants, and epistemic limits within its
stated scope.
