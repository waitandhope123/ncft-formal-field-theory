# Conclusions — NCFT-Core

This work presents a complete computational characterization of **NCFT-core**
within its declared axiomatic scope.

All conclusions below are derived exclusively from executable toy models
designed for falsification rather than confirmation.

## Core Structural Results

1. **Projection is essential**
   - NCFT dynamics are well-posed *only* on the unit-norm manifold.
   - Any relaxation leads to immediate divergence.
   - Projection is not a numerical convenience; it defines the theory.

2. **Single-basin dynamics**
   - All valid dynamics converge to a globally aligned state.
   - No alternative attractors, clusters, or metastable regimes are observed.

3. **No criticality or phase transitions**
   - Finite spectral gap
   - Finite correlation length under locality
   - No marginal modes or scale invariance

4. **Frequency coherence is classificatory**
   - Static or dynamical frequencies do not alter ψ-alignment.
   - Coherence labels regimes but does not enforce stability.

5. **Pure pairwise closure holds**
   - No emergent higher-order interaction terms appear.
   - Dynamics are fully determined by pairwise couplings.

## What NCFT-Core Is

- A **projection-enforced effective interaction theory**
- Strongly damped and non-critical
- Bounded, deterministic, and internally consistent
- Fully characterized by its axioms

---

## What NCFT-Core Is Not

- Not a theory of pattern formation
- Not a theory of critical phenomena
- Not a framework for emergent structure
- Not extensible without modifying the state space or axioms

---

## Epistemic Status

NCFT-core is **complete** within its intended scope.
Remaining work is expository, not exploratory.

Any further development requires **explicit extension** beyond NCFT-core,
such as:
- additional state variables
- alternative manifolds
- symmetry-breaking terms
- conserved quantities

Such extensions constitute **new theories**, not refinements of NCFT-core.

## Final Statement

NCFT-core defines a sharply delimited universality class:
a maximally attractive, projection-enforced interaction framework
with clear stability guarantees and explicit limits.

Its value lies not in unexplored behavior,
but in the precision with which its behavior is now known.
