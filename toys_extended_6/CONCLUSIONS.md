# NCFT — Conclusions from Discriminative Validation

This document states the conclusions justified solely by the results of the
NCFT discriminative toy suite.

---

## Validated Findings

- NCFT does not generate emergent relational structure beyond that produced by
  generic normalized bilinear systems under symmetric dynamics.
- NCFT axioms enforce boundedness and prevent divergence under adversarial
  interaction conditions.
- NCFT excludes classes of unstable bilinear dynamics that are admitted by
  unconstrained null systems.

---

## Interpretation

The discriminative results indicate that NCFT should not be interpreted as a
structure-generating dynamical theory. Instead, its demonstrated contribution
is as a **stability-preserving constraint framework** for bilinear interaction
systems.

## Scope and Limitations

- No empirical, biological, or cosmological claims are validated by these toys.
- Claims are restricted to mathematical boundedness, closure, and exclusion of
  unstable dynamics.
- Exploratory extensions remain non-validated.

## Overall Assessment

Based on discriminative testing, NCFT is a formally coherent framework that
imposes analytically enforced constraints ensuring well-posed dynamics. Its
current validation supports constraint-level guarantees rather than unique
emergent behavior.

All conclusions are limited strictly to demonstrated executable results.
