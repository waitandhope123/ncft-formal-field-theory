# PREDICTIONS

The statements below summarize invariant consequences and conditional
testable implications of NCFT-core within its explicitly defined axiomatic
scope. They are not forward-looking hypotheses, but properties that must hold
for any system accurately described by NCFT-core dynamics.

Predictions are grouped into structural invariants, statistical implications,
scale and universality implications, and explicit non-predictions.

## 1. Structural Invariants (Within Scope)

These properties must hold for any valid NCFT-core dynamics.

### 1.1 Bounded Pairwise Interaction
All bilinear couplings remain bounded within [0, 1] under constitutive
projection. Persistent violations indicate dynamics outside the NCFT-core
state space.

### 1.2 Preservation of Pairwise Closure
Global interaction measures derived from sums of pairwise couplings are
preserved up to numerical tolerance. Sustained violation constitutes structural
incompatibility with NCFT-core.

### 1.3 Single Global Attractor
All valid NCFT-core dynamics converge to a single global attractor. No chaotic
wandering, marginal stability, clustering, or glassy metastability is expected
under any admissible construction.

### 1.4 Spectral Gap and Finite Relaxation
Linear response spectra exhibit a finite spectral gap. Perturbations decay on
finite timescales, excluding marginal modes, critical slowing-down, or
long-lived collective oscillations.

### 1.5 Nontrivial Structure in Pairwise Couplings
NCFT-core produces structured, non-Gaussian distributions of bilinear
couplings (e.g., higher moments, clique density) that are not reducible to mean
coupling strength alone.

### 1.6 Topology Robustness of Core Signatures
Core NCFT-core signatures persist across dense, sparse, random, and structured
interaction topologies. Topology influences transient mixing and correlation
length but not asymptotic behavior.

## 2. Statistical Implications (Conditional)

These implications apply only within explicitly defined detectability regimes.

### 2.1 Detectability Thresholds
NCFT-core signatures are statistically detectable only above explicit
thresholds of signal strength, observability, and sample size. Below these
thresholds, NCFT-core predicts non-detectability rather than failure.

### 2.2 Smooth Power Scaling
Within detectable regimes, statistical power increases smoothly with the
number of independent observations. No sharp detection phase transition is
predicted.

### 2.3 Falsification Conditions
In regimes predicted to be detectable, failure to observe NCFT-core signatures
at defined statistical power constitutes falsification within that regime.

### 2.4 Partial Identifiability
Distinguishability between structured and null dynamics is possible only above
defined observability and noise thresholds. Complete inverse reconstruction is
not predicted in general.

---

## 3. Scale, Locality, and Universality Implications

### 3.1 Effective (Not Invariant) Scale Behavior
Under coarse-graining, aggregated micro-level dynamics approximately track
independently evolved macro-level systems. Deviations remain bounded and
non-accumulating, and exact renormalization closure is not predicted.

### 3.2 Short-Range Collective Behavior Under Locality
When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT-core implies a finite
correlation length that increases smoothly with coupling strength but saturates
well below system size. No emergent long-range or scale-free behavior occurs.

### 3.3 Restricted Universality Class
NCFT-core defines a sharply delimited universality class: projection-enforced,
approximately bilinear interaction dynamics that converge to a common late-time
structure. Generic normalized dynamics do not.

---

## 4. Explicit Non-Predictions (Out of Scope)

NCFT-core makes no predictions regarding:

- Dynamics off the unit-norm manifold or without constitutive projection,
- Higher-order (non-pairwise) interaction terms,
- Criticality, scale-free dynamics, or diverging correlation lengths,
- Long-range collective transport under locality,
- Marginal stability, glassy dynamics, chaos, or clustering,
- Exact renormalization invariance or generic universality,
- Complete inverse reconstruction from partial or noisy data,
- Detectability outside explicitly defined regimes.

All statements above are derived directly from the axiomatic structure and are
supported exclusively by behaviors that persist across the full executable toy
suite. No claims are made beyond these boundaries.
