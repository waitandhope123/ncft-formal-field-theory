# PREDICTIONS

Predictions derived from NCFT are restricted strictly to projection-enforced,
coherent-phase dynamics within the theory’s stated scope. To prevent
overextension or misinterpretation, predictions are grouped into structural
predictions, statistical predictions, scale and universality predictions, and
explicit non-predictions.

## 1. Structural Predictions (Invariant Within Scope)

These predictions must hold for any system accurately described by NCFT-core
dynamics.

### 1.1 Bounded Pairwise Interaction
All bilinear couplings remain bounded within [0, 1] under projection-enforced
dynamics. Persistent violations indicate decoherent regimes or non-NCFT
interaction laws.

### 1.2 Preservation of the Purity Identity
The density-matrix purity identity linking sums of pairwise couplings to reduced
state purity is preserved up to numerical tolerance. Sustained violation
constitutes structural incompatibility with NCFT.

### 1.3 Deterministic Attractor Convergence
Coherent NCFT dynamics converge to a dominant attractor basin. No chaotic
wandering, marginal stability, or glassy metastability is predicted within the
coherent phase.

### 1.4 Spectral Gap and Finite Relaxation
The linear response spectrum around coherent NCFT attractors exhibits a finite
spectral gap. Perturbations decay on finite timescales, excluding critical
slowing-down or marginal modes.

### 1.5 Higher-Order Structure in Pairwise Couplings
NCFT produces nontrivial higher-order structure in the distribution of bilinear
couplings (e.g., tail mass, kurtosis, clique density) that cannot be reduced to
mean coupling strength alone.

### 1.6 Topology Independence of Core Signatures
Core NCFT signatures persist across dense, sparse, random, and structured
interaction topologies, subject to coherence constraints.

## 2. Statistical Predictions (Conditional and Testable)

These predictions apply only within regimes identified as statistically
accessible.

### 2.1 Detectability Thresholds
NCFT signatures are statistically detectable only above explicit thresholds of
signal strength, coherence, observability, and sample size. Below these
thresholds, NCFT predicts non-detectability.

### 2.2 Smooth Power Scaling
Within detectable regimes, statistical power increases smoothly with the number
of independent events. No sharp detection phase transition is predicted.

### 2.3 Falsification Conditions
In regimes predicted to be detectable, failure to observe NCFT signatures at
defined power and false-positive rates constitutes falsification within that
regime.

### 2.4 Partial Identifiability
Distinguishability between structured and null dynamics is possible only above
defined observability and noise thresholds. Full inverse reconstruction is not
predicted in general.

## 3. Scale, Locality, and Universality Predictions

### 3.1 Effective, Not Invariant, Scale Behavior
Under coarse-graining, aggregated micro-level dynamics approximately track
independently evolved macro-level systems, but exact renormalization closure is
not predicted. Errors remain bounded and non-accumulating.

### 3.2 Short-Range Collective Behavior Under Locality
When interactions are restricted to local graphs, NCFT predicts a finite
correlation length. Correlation length increases smoothly with coupling strength
but saturates well below system size, excluding emergent long-range or
scale-free behavior.

### 3.3 Restricted Universality Class
A finite family of approximately bilinear, projection-enforced interaction laws
converge to NCFT-like late-time structure. Generic normalized dynamics do not.

---

## 4. Explicit Non-Predictions (Out of Scope)

NCFT makes no predictions regarding:

- Decoherent or unprojected regimes,
- Criticality, scale-free dynamics, or diverging correlation lengths,
- Marginal stability, critical slowing-down, or glassy dynamics,
- Long-range collective transport under locality,
- Exact renormalization invariance,
- Complete inverse reconstruction from partial or noisy data,
- Detectability outside explicitly defined regimes.

All predictions above are derived directly from the axiomatic structure and are
supported exclusively by behaviors that persist across the full computational
toy suite. No claims are made beyond these boundaries.
