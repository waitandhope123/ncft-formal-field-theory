# CONCLUSIONS — NCFT INTRINSIC TARGET-OVERLAP DYNAMICS (TOY F)

This document states conclusions that are directly supported by the numerical results
of Toy F. Claims are restricted to demonstrated behavior within the model.

## 1. INTRINSIC DYNAMICS ARE STABLE AT SCALE

The intrinsic (tangent-space) update scheme:

- Preserves state normalization by construction
- Prevents coupling bound violations
- Remains stable for N = 10⁶ and long runtimes
- Requires no projection for boundedness

**Conclusion:**  
NCFT admits a mathematically and numerically stable intrinsic formulation.

## 2. COLLAPSE IS NOT GEOMETRICALLY INEVITABLE

Unlike purely attractive intrinsic models, the target-overlap energy functional:

- Prevents convergence to ⟨C⟩ → 1
- Produces finite, controlled overlap statistics
- Avoids trivial global coherence

**Conclusion:**  
Collapse is a consequence of force design, not an inherent feature of NCFT geometry.

---

## 3. NON-TRIVIAL STRUCTURE CAN BE SUSTAINED

The system converges to a state characterized by:

- Finite mean overlap
- Extremely low variance
- Stable, homogeneous structure
- Persistent equilibrium under intrinsic dynamics

**Conclusion:**  
NCFT supports stable, non-collapsed intrinsic equilibria with controlled structure.

## 4. TARGET-OVERLAP IS A VIABLE CONTROL MECHANISM

The single control parameter C₀:

- Determines equilibrium overlap scale
- Is reached accurately in large-N dynamics
- Produces reproducible outcomes across time

**Conclusion:**  
Target-overlap dynamics provide a reliable and tunable mechanism for structuring
intrinsic NCFT evolution.

## FINAL STATEMENT

Toy F establishes that NCFT:

- Is axiomatically consistent under intrinsic evolution
- Is numerically stable at large system sizes
- Can sustain non-trivial structure without projection
- Possesses controllable equilibrium behavior via local interaction design

These conclusions concern **mathematical correctness and dynamical behavior only**.
Interpretations beyond this scope are not asserted here.
